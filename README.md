The project is about making a business website. We decided on making a website selling movies and seasons of popular shows. The website also shows genres of the movies/seasons alongwith their IMDb rating so the user knows what season/movie would be best for him. The website uses HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT for an interactive experience and includes signin/login functionality, a feedback and contact form, an about section defining our objectives and who we are, the team and such.
